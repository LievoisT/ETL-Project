# ETL-Project

* Jupyter Notebook containing the final draft of data extraction/transforming/load code of videogame sales data is VG_Transform_Final
* Second notebook containing the scraping code/data from Metacritic is called Review_Scrape
* Schema for Postgres SQL included
* Rough drafts of data extraction/transformation in VG_Transform_Table and Data_Transform
* secret.py file needed for PostgreSQL database access with SQLAlchemy. Place in root with VG_Transform_Final
* As it stands, we have kept the scraping function separate as the scraping process takes well over 3 hours with our machines. To avoid that process if you would like, please find the link to the csv file for import.

* However, the scraping works well and if you would like to run it in its entirety, god speed.
